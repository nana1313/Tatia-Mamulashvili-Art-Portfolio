          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Born in Georgia and now based in East London, artist
          Tatia Mamulashvili is a painter whose practice inhabits the
          intersection of figurative expressionism, abstraction, and
          installation.<br /><br />
          Mamulashvili’s work explores the fragile boundary between internal and
          external worlds. Her figures, often dissolving or metamorphosing into
          space, embody a shifting sense of identity — one that moves between
          self and others. Disrupting the idea of a body as a whole, unified
          object — a Gestalt — she manifests the fragmented, unstable way the
          subject experiences themselves. Her blurry, ambiguous figures suggest
          inner states that are constantly changing, unknown even to herself.
          Through painting, she probes for hidden and forgotten feelings: love,
          grief, loss, and fear — using art as a field for what remains
          undefined.<br /><br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The artist’s methodology is rooted in spontaneity
          and a slow emotional intuition. She begins with a vague, shifting
          image, allowing it to evolve during the creative process. Mamulashvili
          often works with bricolage, combining fragile and used materials —
          papers, fabrics, and found objects — each carrying its own ineffable
          history and energy. Wrapping papers, polystyrene curtains, Georgian
          curtains from her hometown, and trash bin bags — these materials,
          transported from their original purposes, are transformed through
          cutting, tearing, sewing, and glueing. In these acts of damage and
          repair, Mamulashvili expresses both destruction and healing, exploring
          impermanence, vulnerability, and renewal.<br /><br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving towards installation marks a new emergence in
          her practice. With a background in architecture and traditional
          academic art training — where precision, perspective, and the comfort
          of certainty were keystones — Mamulashvili now chooses to create
          spaces that reject safety and challenge stability. Instead of
          designing harmonious environments, she constructs fragmented,
          unsettling spaces that invite emotional and psychological engagement.
          She aims not to offer comfort but to provoke direct embodied
          responses, allowing viewers to feel, question, and inhabit the
          emotional landscapes she creates.
