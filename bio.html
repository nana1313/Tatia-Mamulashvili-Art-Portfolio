        <p>
          Born in Georgia and now based in East London, artist
          Tatia Mamulashvili is a painter whose practice inhabits the
          intersection of figurative expressionism, abstraction, and
          installation.<br /><br />
          Mamulashvili’s work explores the fragile boundary between internal and
          external worlds. Her figures, often dissolving or metamorphosing into
          space, embody a shifting sense of identity, one that moves between
          self and others. Disrupting the idea of a body as a whole unified
          object, she manifests the fragmented, unstable way the subject
          experiences themselves. Her blurry, ambiguous figures suggest inner
          states that are constantly changing, unknown even to herself.
          <br /><br />
          Through painting, she probes for hidden and
          forgotten feelings: love, grief, loss, and fear- using art as a field
          for what remains undefined.<br /><br />
          Mamulashvili often works with bricolage, combining
          fragile and used materials such as paper, fabrics, Georgian curtains
          from her hometown, bin bags and found objects. Each carrying its own
          ineffable history and energy these materials, transported from their
          original purposes, are transformed through cutting, tearing, sewing,
          and glueing. In these acts of damage and repair, Mamulashvili
          expresses both destruction and healing, exploring impermanence,
          vulnerability, and renewal. <br /><br />
          Moving towards installation marks a new emergence in
          her practice. With a background in architecture and traditional
          academic art training - where precision, perspective, and the comfort
          of certainty were keystones - Mamulashvili now chooses to create
          spaces that reject safety and challenge stability. Instead of
          designing harmonious environments, she constructs fragmented,
          unsettling spaces that invite emotional and psychological engagement.
          She aims not to offer comfort but to provoke direct embodied
          responses, allowing viewers to feel, question, and inhabit the
          emotional landscapes she creates.<br /><br /><br /><br/>
